SporksIRCD FAQ
--------------
Q: What are the differences between ShadowIRCD and SporksIRCD?
A: SporksIRCD is generally more leinent on upstream features than ShadowIRCD
   is. As a result, we include more goodies such as modularised censor, owner,
   force* commands, and many cleanups/various enhancements.

Q: Why doesn't SporksIRCD have remote includes?
A: Remote Includes are a possible security risk due to possible MITM attacks
   and such and do not prevent server owners making changes that you do not
   want them to so they have little point. It is recommended to use rsync or a
   git/hg cron job to pull in remote configuration files. We at SporksMoo use a
   special system called confsync, which we have made open-source and can be
   found at http://hg.sporksmoo.net/confsync.

Q: Does SporksIRCD support Windows?
A: No. Not now, at least. It may at some time in the future. It will require a
   bit more work before Windows support is 100% useable.

Q: I want shun, m_invisible, unreal-style m_spy, etc!
A: m_spy is considered excessively abusive, as well as any "invisible" modes
   that are of little legitimate use. We are a little more lenient than
   upstream about implementing potentially "abusive" features, but they are
   implemented with a clause that says "if you use this for evil, you cannot
   use this module." We are fully within our legal rights to do so, as modules
   are our own work.

Q: What services should I run with SporksIRCD?
A: We support atheme with a patch to include a SporksIRCD protocol module.
   There is a patch in the patches/ directory.

Q: I've got two servers linked and users on one are getting constant flood
   notices when trying to send to channels. HELP!!!!
A: Has your server's clock gone backwards massively recently? (probably due to it
   being incorrect). If so, you have two options. You can either wait for the real
   time to be what the incorrect time was, or you can restart the affected server.
