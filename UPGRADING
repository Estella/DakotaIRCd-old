This is the documentation of major configuration/other changes to SporksIRCD
you should be aware of before upgrading your ircd. If anything is not covered
here, this is a bug and should be reported to the developers.

Changes between 1.3 and 1.4:

= Modules
- botmode.so, ip_cloaking.so, and override.so have had usm_ prepended to their
  names, in line with the chm_* modes (these are USer Modes).
- Censor is now a module, as well as the module to make it oper only (see
  chm_censor.so and chm_censor_operonly.so). Semantics are otherwise the same.
- m_chgflags.so has been added to change a user's auth flags (backported to
  1.3 but unsupported in that version).
- m_forcequit.so has been moved to unsupported. See the directions in
  unsupported/ for more information.
- m_remove.so exists as a module now for ircd-seven style /remove. Its use is
  discouraged but is nonetheless supported.
- sno_channeljoin.so has been moved out of unsupported and can be used to view
  join/part notices.

= Configuration
- oper:grant is now a required privset to use override.
- privset blocks now support an operstring field, which sets the default oper
  string for that class. Note that operstring fields in oper blocks will
  override this.
- Account fields are now supported in oper blocks. This means that the user's
  account name must match the given account name in order to be able to oper
  up.
- caps_threshold in the channel block has been moved to the blockcaps {} block
  as the threshold option. The semantics are otherwise the same.
- max_censors and max_censors_large have been moved to the censor {} block with
  the same semantics as before.
- expire_override_time and make_override_immune have been moved to the override
  {} block as the expire_time and make_immune settings, with the same
  semantics.
- Flood control settings are now configurable. client_flood_burst_rate,
  client_flood_burst_max, client_flood_message_time, client_flood_message_num
  are all configurable settings. The defaults for them are considered sane and
  should not be changed unless you know what you are doing. However,
  client_flood_max_lines may be tweaked and does what the old (removed)
  client_flood option does.

= Miscellaneous
- DES is deprecated and will spew warnings if it is being used for passwords.
  Please upgrade your passwords to a stronger function (DES is easily cracked).
- IPv6 blacklists are now supported via a type parameter (must come before the
  reason). Note not many blacklists support IPv6 yet and thus the default is
  still IPv4.
