[F] finish legacy code removal
    [ ] client.c, channel.c is very 2.8 style still. it'd be nice to pack them
        into their own namespace and such. moreover, the other 2.8 code needs
        similar rewriting/reworking too...
    [ ] rewrite s_auth.c
        [ ] authentication state/lock manager
        [ ] move resolver/auth checker code into separated modules 
[F] Module engine rework
    [ ] MODULE_DEPEND and MODULE_CONFLICT for building extension dependencies
    [ ] make nick/user/host validation functions/match tables able to work in
        separated modules, this will help us making support for native
        characters sets/slashes in host etc
    [ ] auth checker module
    [ ] resolver module
    [ ] move core modes into modules
[/] test suite as in ircu
[ ] Figure out how to pre-build lex/flex and yacc stuff so we don't need to
    require them for the ircd
[x] Add ability to add capabilities via module, like in Hybrid
[x] Make remove a module
[ ] Make halfop/owner/founder into server CAPs to facilitiate backwards compat.
[/] Win32/Win64 support.
[?] Channel flags (atheme's flags but in a channel mode)
[ ] Save channel info (e.g. bans, topics, access lists, modes) for +P channels
    in a persistent database rather than in memory only
[x] IPv6 blacklist support (should also go upstream)
