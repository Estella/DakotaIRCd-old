\section{Scope of this document}
	This document describes the commands and functions available to
	operators in SporksIRCD, as used on
	\htmladdnormallink{SporksMoo}{http://sporksmoo.net}.

	While this document may be of some interest to the users of SporksIRCd
	servers, it is intended as a reference for network staff.


\section{About this document}
	This document is largely based on the charybdis documentation, although
	edited to document differences.

	Charybdis took this document in docbook form from
	dancer-{}ircd/hyperion (the ircd formerly used on freenode), mainly
	written by Andrew Suffield and Jilles Tjoelker. It was converted from
	SGML docbook (an obsolescent format) to	LaTeX format via dblatex by
	Elizabeth Jennifer Myers (and subsequently cleaned up by her). Andrew
	Wilcox did most of the heavy lifting of getting the markup in a usable
	state and also aided with cleanup.

	Since the conversion, Lee T. Starnes has been the primary caretaker of
	this document, although Elizabeth has helped in spurts.

	The HTML LaTeX version of these docs are generated by html2latex. A
	regularly updated (about every 3 hours) HTML version can be found
	\htmladdnormallink{here}{http://gewt.net/~init/sporksircd-docs}.


\section{About SporksIRCD}
	SporksIRCD is a ShadowIRCd derivative (a close Charybdis derivative).
	However, since the split, SporksIRCD bases itself more closely on
	Charybdis, with a few select changes from ircd-{}ratbox 3.x and
	ircd-{}seven. Charybdis is based on ircd-{}ratbox 3.0.0, although
	much has changed. ircd-{}ratbox is an old fork of ircd-{}hybrid;
	however, it bears little resemblance to its ancestor.
	\htmladdnormallink{ircd-{}ratbox}{http://www.ircd-ratbox.org} is
	commonly used on efnet, and some other networks.
	\htmladdnormallink{Charybdis}{http://www.stack.nl/~jilles/irc/\#charybdis}
	is used on \htmladdnormallink{StaticBox}{http://staticbox.org} and
	\htmladdnormallink{SorceryNet}{http://www.sorcery.net/}; a close
	derivative, ircd-seven, is used on freenode (although usage of
	ircd-seven by the public is discouraged). ShadowIRCD is used on
	\htmladdnormallink{ThinStack}{http://thinstack.net} and a few other
	networks.
