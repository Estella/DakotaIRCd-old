The SporksIRCD project would like to give thanks to the following projects; the
developers of all the projects below are far too numerous to name, but our
thanks goes to them.
 
ShadowIRCD:
ShadowIRCd 6 is a modern restart of the old ShadowIRCd project based on
Charybdis with a few additional features to make it appeal more to more users.
 
Some ShadowIRCd 6 features such as remote RESTART, DIE, and MOD* commands were
borrowed from ircd-seven.

ircd-seven:
ircd-seven is developed to meet the policy needs of the freenode IRC network.
The ircd is based closely on Charybdis, which in turn is a fork of ircd-ratbox.

Charybdis:
Charybdis started as an evolution from ircd-ratbox. Its development is led by a
team of dedicated developers who have put a lot of time into the project, and
it has seen use on a variety of different network configurations.

ircd-ratbox: 
ircd-ratbox is an evolution where ircd-hybrid left off around version 7-rc1.
